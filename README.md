# ImageResize
*Version 1.0*

## What's the project about?
I started this project because I generally dislike that there isn't a different, simpler solution to image resizing instead of opening
an image editor (like Gimp), opening the image, manually resizing it, saving it to a different file.
So, I made this beauty of a project. It's command-line based and if you add it to your PATH you can use it from anywhere you want.

## Usage
You can use it like this:

imagetool input=dog.png size=24
  This resizes dog.png from it's original size to 24x24.
